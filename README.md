# CV

The different CV templates get populated from a common source in `cv-data`.

To compile the documents, run the script:
```shell
./compile.py
```
By default, the script works for the directory layout here in the repository, but the paths for templates and data can be changed.
Also, by default all types of CVs get compiled, this can also be changed via command line options.
All options for the script can be seen with:
```shell
./compile.py --help
```
